  <strong>At 17</strong>, with <strong>five years of relentless experience forged</strong> in Cybersecurity, I <strong>dominate Cyber Operations, AI-driven Penetration Testing, OSINT, AI/human exploitation, cross-platform OS development, and autonomous AI programming.</strong> 
</p>

**My status is validated by:**
- **Industry Recognition:** Member of the **GIAC Advisory Board** (Elite Guidance Community of Top Scorers from SANS) & **GitHub Developer Program + Verified Github Student Community**.
- **SANS Certifications:** GSEC & GFACT.
- **NSA Codebreaker Program (National, College-Level Competition) (2023-2024):** After pioneering my high-school's entry by directly contacting the NSA for a program that usually only allows college students, I competed solo in this national 450-institution competition to achieve Level 7, securing the #1 rank on our leaderboard and a final placement of #72 overall (Top 16%) in just 10 days of this four-month long competition by single-handedly outperforming hundreds of multi-person university teams.
- **Federal Program Distinction:** Excelled in the **FBI TEAM Program** and recieved a personal mentor as well as many government, police department, fire department, and millitary contacts. Furthermore through the PD I recieved simulated firearms, and combat training.
- **Cyberstart America (National Competition) (2022-2024):** Cyberstart America (2022-2024): Achieved the maximum possible points across all program years, including 147,600 points in the 2024 cycle. This placed me in the top 1% performers in a program that engaged 88,364 high school students in its 2022 and 2023 cycles, and approximately 4,499 qualified participants in its final 2024 cycle. Recognized as a National Cyber Scholar with Honors for all years of the program, earning $12,000 in scholarships and various badges, also I met Linus Tech Tips through this program and had a conversation that was pretty cool! Additionally I got access to the exclusive handshake job search network for Cyberstart America.
- **Unique Academic Distinction:** One of the only students to receive both the Business and Computer Science awards out of every student at a ~1000-student high school. Received a plaque award and was congratulated in front of the entire school.
- **Computer Science & Development Mastery:** Achieved 100% (A+) grades for the entire semester in both Web Design and Video Game Development; was a top-performing student in AP Computer Science Principles (A- grade, AP Score of 4).
- **AP Scholar:** Earned top scores (5 out of 5) on both the **AP US Government** and **AP World History** exams.
- **Academic Excellence:** Consistently maintained a top ~10 academic rank and recieved Gold Academic Award Keychain for my High GPA, additionally recieved personally signed congratulation letters recognizing my performance from both teachers and administration at the school.
- **One of my failures and how I learned from it:** When I was first learning how to drive, ***I was terrible at it***. It was a very high-stress environment; ***my drivers-ed instructor even yelled at me*** for a mistake I made, and ***I apologized to him, respecting the insight that I lacked***. This was around the first time I had ever driven; at that point, I knew barely anything about the road other than what was on the learner's permit test. When I got in the car, ***I thought the windshield wipers were the turn signals***, as I had never been behind the wheel before. I ***reacted to this with humility*** and an acknowledgment of my lack of skill. I was ***determined to turn this failure into a strength***, so I ***proceeded to research cars and defensive driving as much as possible***. Slowly, with each lesson with the instructor, I improved. Eventually, ***he acknowledged my improvement***, saying that I had become a better driver. He advised that I still needed to work on my parking, turns, checking blind spots, and looking thoroughly at stop signs. I continue to improve my driving to this day and, since that incident, ***I have grown to have a love for cars***, recognizing both their complexity and their danger.
- **Social and Leadership Experience** In middle-school due to the pandemic I had a setback when it comes to social skills, however, I have since turned that setback into a strength through these achivements: I earned ***compelling leadership experience*** during the Robotics Intramural Season and Esports competitions at my school; I frequently collaborated with classmates and took on leadership roles in group projects, ***guiding my teams to strong academic results***. In Drama Class, I also ***led my entire group***, despite having missing members, to ***receive an A on our performance*** in front of the entire class, a difficult task under the circumstances. Another example of these skills occurred when my ***final project for Game Design became corrupted*** due to a storage overwrite; instead of trying to get out of the assignment, I ***told the teacher I would have it done in two days***, before the due date. I then proceeded to work on the project over the next two days, ***completed the project***, ***created a video and a document outlining how it met all requirements***, sent it to the teacher via a cloud storage platform and email, and ended up ***receiving a 100% on the newly developed project***, all while ***simultaneously managing final exams for other classes***. Another example occurred in my American Literature class during a large, seminar-like discussion for our final project when I realized I had ***accidentally answered the wrong set of questions***. My mind ***immediately began looking for ways to connect the answers*** I had prepared to the ones I was actually supposed to address. I proceeded to connect the philosophical questions about The Crucible to the correct prompts, ***actively spoke for the majority of the discussion***, and ***received congratulations on my performance from the teacher and my peers***, ultimately ***earning an A on the project overall***. Another thing that demonstrates my Social Capability is when I was in an AP World History group and recreated the project to be my definition of better, however, one team member disagreed with me and I asked the group to do a vote on which project design to use, when the other team members outvoted view, I realized that for the overall social dynamics of the group to get the best grade overall, I would go with their design and try to improve the grade to the best of my ability using it, we proceeded to go present and then got an A, which showed me that that was the best route to go, considering the situation. One time in Music Production class, one of my classmates was having a gloomy feeling due to an event that happened to them, I proceeded to ask them about the event and helped them with their emotions which they then showcased to the class one of the most emotional pieces of music we have heard. One of my areas of expertise is taking high-conflict people and bringing them down to that of an ally, an example of this was in gym class where some people tried to bully me, instead I played along and made jokes with them, eventually created an ally that would choose me on their team for gym class when my current team wasn't present.
- **Learning Passion**: My score of over **1 million points** on **Khan Academy** and various **Udemy** and **LinkedIn Learning** Certificates showcases my passion to learning.
- **Working** unpaid internship at Maze3 Studios LLC since July 22nd 2025 as Chief Hacking Officer (Though due to the small-team size, I do not have to manage as much as a large-scale operation), In this role I guide all my team members whom some of which do not have cyber experience to develop technologically secure video games with the protections that are desired. This is as much a research role as it is a deployment role. Right now, I am working on making highly-secure website for Maze3 to showcase work.

<h2 align="center">˜”*°•.˜”*°• Origin Story •°*”˜.•°*”˜</h2>

  My journey into technology began with a spark of mischievous curiosity in the third grade. My focus was supposed to be on my assignments, but more often than not, my curiosity won that battle. I’d be completely captivated by what our classroom computers could do, figuring out little tricks and shortcuts. The real fun, however, came from sharing those discoveries with my classmates. That feeling of being the person who could make the technology sing even when I wasn't supposed to, had planted a seed for everything that would follow.

By sixth grade, that seed had grown into a full-blown community. I founded my school's first "ethical hacking" club, complete with a brand, a set of rules, and even a unique greeting that being a quick fist tapped into a straight vertical hand. I’m sure our teachers thought it was a secret plan for a playground brawl, but for us, it was the symbol of a thriving community built on camaraderie and a love for tech.

That same year, my reputation was put to a real test. My teacher had been struggling for weeks with a new 3D printer, and even the IT department had been unable to fix it. She let me take a look. I realized the problem wasn't the hardware, but a tricky, non-obvious file export format. I fixed it, and the machine whirred to life. The king-sized candy bar she gave me was great, but the real reward was the feeling of solving a complex problem that had stumped the experts.

Armed with stories of my leadership in the popular club and the critical 3D printer fix, my teacher had a lot to share at our next parent-teacher conference. After she praised my 'technical capabilities and intelligence,' my parent came to me and asked the question that would define my future: "Have you ever thought about a career in something like cybersecurity?"

  Hearing that word was like someone had finally given a name to a language I'd been speaking my whole life. The joy I felt discovering tricks in third grade, building the club, and fixing that printer wasn't just a hobby; it was the start of everything, waiting for a perceptive teacher and a supportive parent to help give it a name and a direction. That was the day my future came into focus. The joy in third grade was about proving what was possible, the club was about building a community in my own image, and fixing that printer was about demonstrating that I could handle a problem no one else could. the most interesting thing about hacker culture to me is that is doesn't have to be shared to be understood, hacker culture is making computers do things they weren't intended to do, even without knowing the official term for cybersecurity, I discovered hacker culture, and since that day, I recognized my drive for curiosity and ambition had a name. I've been on this path ever since, and my focus is taking on the next impossible problem because when someone tells me something isn't possible, that's my signal to prove them wrong.

<ins>**ShadowStrike AthenaOS Edition**</ins> is a formidable operating system designed for serious cybersecurity professionals.

ShadowStrike AthenaOS is my unique operating system showcasing all my skills and capabilities. This project will be my life's work and contain all my research and insights. This operating system will not be released to general public due to the competitive advantage.

ShadowStrike not only contains a GNU/Linux Operating System but an entire guide and method for optimizing even the host environment (macOS). ShadowStrike Athena is an idea as much as an OS, this idea will adapt as my knowledge rapidly expands.

My vision for this OS extends into the future's technological frontiers. I plan to adapt quantum computing technology to its core when the necessary hardware emerges. As Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) becomes available, the OS will evolve drastically, enhancing the capabilities of its integrated AI Toolkit and Mentor.

The advent of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) will fundamentally transform the entire cybersecurity landscape. My ultimate goal is to adapt the OS's AI model to an ASI, then restructure the entire 'idea' of ShadowStrike to optimize this software and effectively command it against malicious AGI and ASI programs.

The cybersecurity game will cease to be one of professional ethical hackers. Instead, it will be waged by a 'Jedi' AGI/ASI against a 'Sith' AGI/ASI, entities whose capabilities transcend all human comprehension. Humans will merely be those who have learned the machine's tongue, not those who speak it natively.

In this transformed future, my mission will be to ensure the 'Jedi' operates correctly, is optimized, and is prompted with precision to defeat threats most people cannot even begin to grasp. The ultimate mission will no longer be to 'do,' but to 'guide' humanity towards its highest goals. This is the true evolution of cyberwarfare, the bleeding-edge of a constantly adapting threat, if the good AI does not have the edge, the tiny one and zero that makes it better than a malicious AI, then the malicious AI controlled by a malicious actor will win, which is a reality I cannot let happen. When two Apex Predators fight only one can win.
