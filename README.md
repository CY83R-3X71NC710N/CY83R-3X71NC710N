### About Me

My fascination with technology began not with formal coursework, but with a fundamental curiosity about how systems work. This passion, which I've pursued since the age of 12, led me to cybersecurity. I have now spent five years deeply immersed in systems engineering, offensive security tradecraft, and autonomous tool development. My focus is on building robust, security-first solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible at the intersection of AI and systems security. I am driven by taking on complex challenges and engineering effective, elegant solutions.

#### **Eclipse Shield - AI-Powered Productivity Analyzer with Enterprise Security** - [View Repository](https://github.com/CY83R-3X71NC710N/Eclipse-Shield)
An intelligent productivity management system that uses AI to analyze user browsing patterns and block unproductive websites based on contextual task understanding. The application features a web-based backend that communicates with browser extensions to provide real-time productivity insights and adaptive website filtering.

**Core Functionality:**
* **AI Task Analysis:** Google Gemini integration that asks contextual questions to understand user goals and current work focus
* **Intelligent Website Blocking:** Dynamic filtering system that blocks distracting sites based on current task context rather than static blacklists
* **Browser Extension Integration:** Cross-platform extensions (Chrome/Opera) that communicate securely with the backend for real-time blocking decisions
* **Adaptive Learning:** System learns user productivity patterns and adjusts blocking behavior accordingly
* **Domain-Specific Profiles:** Configurable productivity profiles for different work contexts (development, research, writing, etc.)

**Enterprise Security Implementation:** Applied comprehensive OWASP Top 10 security measures to demonstrate production-grade security engineering:
* **Multi-layered Defense:** UFW firewall → Fail2ban intrusion detection → Nginx reverse proxy → Gunicorn WSGI → Flask security middleware
* **Complete OWASP Compliance:** All 2021 OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities addressed including injection prevention, access control, and cryptographic security
* **Advanced Rate Limiting:** Redis-backed IP throttling preventing DDoS and API abuse
* **Input Validation Engine:** Comprehensive sanitization preventing XSS, SQL injection, and prompt injection attacks
* **API Security Framework:** CSRF tokens, secure authentication, and request signing for browser extension communication

**Technical Architecture:**
* **Backend:** Flask with custom security middleware, thread-safe caching, structured security logging
* **AI Integration:** Secure Google Gemini API integration with prompt injection prevention and response validation
* **Browser Extensions:** Secure message passing between web pages and backend API with authentication
* **DevOps:** Docker containerization, automated security-hardened deployment, real-time monitoring

**Security Testing Suite:** 50+ automated security tests covering authentication bypass, injection attacks, rate limiting, and cross-site scripting prevention.

#### **Event_Zero – Autonomous Malware Annihilation Engine - [View Repository](https://github.com/CY83R-3X71NC710N/Event_Zero**
An advanced, AI-driven security architecture designed for the autonomous deconstruction and complete behavioral mapping of malicious code. This system represents a paradigm shift from traditional sandboxing to an intelligent, self-healing analysis engine that operates until 100% of a threat's functionality is understood and neutralized.

This is not a sandbox. It is a black site for malware.

**Core Architecture & Philosophy:**
The system is built on the principle of **offensive analysis** that is: proactively dismantling a threat with an arsenal of tools rather than passively observing it. It gives a Tier 1 generative AI complete autonomy within a hardened BlackArch Linux container, creating an adaptive predator that hunts, isolates, and dissects malware with zero human intervention.

*   **Autonomous Decision Core:** A Google Gemini-powered reasoning engine with full authority to install any of BlackArch's 2800+ tools, write custom analysis scripts, and define its own success criteria. The mission ends only when the AI declares 100% behavioral mapping is complete.
*   **Adaptive Analysis Engine:** The system's strategy evolves in real-time. If initial static analysis reveals a packed binary, the AI will autonomously install and utilize unpacking tools. If network C2 traffic is detected, it will pivot to dynamic network interception and protocol analysis.
*   **Self-Healing Protocol:** Failure is not an option. If a chosen tool fails or a script throws an error, the AI analyzes the failure, consults its knowledge base of common package conflicts and syntax errors, and regenerates corrected code. The analysis continues, seamlessly.
*   **Complete Behavioral Annihilation:** The goal extends beyond simple IOC (Indicator of Compromise) generation. Event_Zero maps every function, every system call, every library interaction, and every possible execution path, translating the raw technical data into a plain-English behavioral profile and threat assessment.

**Technical & Security Implementation:**
*   **Analysis Environment:** Hardened, ephemeral Docker containers running a custom-configured BlackArch Linux image.
*   **AI Integration:** Secure, rate-limited API communication with Google's Gemini Pro models, featuring prompt injection defenses and structured response validation.
*   **Tooling Orchestration:** Dynamic, intelligent management of an expansive toolset, including but not limited to: Radare2, Ghidra, Frida, Yara, Wireshark, Volatility, and GDB.
*   **System Integrity:** The host system is completely isolated from the analysis environment. The AI operates within a non-persistent container with restricted kernel access and no path to the underlying OS.
