### About Me

My fascination with technology began not with formal coursework, but with a fundamental curiosity about how systems work and a drive to make computers do things they weren't originally designed to do. This passion led me to cybersecurity, where I've spent the last five years deeply immersed in systems engineering, offensive security tradecraft, and autonomous tool development. My focus is on building robust, security-first solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible at the intersection of AI and systems security. I am driven by taking on complex challenges and engineering effective, elegant solutions.

### Key Achievements & Recognition

* **NSA Codebreaker Challenge (2023-2024):** Placed #72 out of 450+ competing institutions. Competing solo, I surpassed hundreds of multi-person university teams, achieving Level 7 in just 10 days of the four-month national competition.
* **GIAC Advisory Board Member:** Recognized as a top scorer on SANS certification exams, invited to join this elite community of security professionals.
* **National Cyber Scholar with Honors (2022-2024):** Achieved maximum points in the Cyberstart America competition across all program years, consistently placing in the top 1% of tens of thousands of participants and earning $12,000 in scholarships.
* **SANS Certifications:** GSEC (GIAC Security Essentials), GFACT (GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies).
* **GitHub Developer Program Member:** Verified member of GitHub's professional developer community.

### Featured Projects

#### **ShadowStrike OS - [Private Repository]**
A custom, security-focused Linux distribution engineered for penetration testing and security research. This project is my primary development testbed for integrating novel security tools and system hardening techniques.
* **Architecture:** Built on a hardened Fedora base, integrating the Pop!_OS tiling window manager (COSMIC), and leveraging a Blackarch Docker container for an expanded toolset.
* **Key Features:** Role-based tooling menus, ARM64 virtualization support, integrated Wireguard configurations, and a custom AI-powered assistant for automating research tasks.
* **Future Roadmap:** Researching the integration of post-quantum cryptography standards and developing more sophisticated adversarial AI threat modeling tools.

#### **Open Source Contributions**
* **[spotify_to_ytmusic](https://github.com/CY83R-3X71NC710N/spotify_to_ytmusic):** Revived an unmaintained project by patching the core authentication error, implementing connection stability features, and integrating four major community bug fixes. My fork became the de facto version for the community during the original author's absence. ([View PR #117](https://github.com/linsomniac/spotify_to_ytmusic/pull/117))
* **[swayfx](https://github.com/WillPower3309/swayfx/pull/406):** Patched a critical build failure in the Wayland compositor fork by updating its Nix flake dependencies, improving the development shell for all contributors.
* **[SillyTavern Extension](https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-Speech-Recognition/pull/19):** Deployed a "heartbeat" mechanism to fix a persistent bug in the Web Speech API implementation for a popular AI toolkit (16k+ stars).
